# TODO: Phase V5 - Autonomous Intelligence & Tactical Routing 🛡️🧠

## ✅ Completed in V4
- [x] Create `WhatsappTransport` (Twilio API Bridge)
- [x] Create `IpfsTransport` (Decentralized storage layer)
- [x] Unit tests for all new transports
- [x] Mesh Core: Peermap with RTT and Hop diagnostics
- [x] Survival Sensors: EnvironmentalService (Radiation/Gas/Seismic)
- [x] Robotics Bridge: DroneService and RoboticsProtocol

## 🚀 Phase V5 Targets (Intelligence & Advanced Routing)

### 1. Mesh Routing [ ]
- [ ] Implement AODV (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector)
- [ ] Implement OLSRv2 (Optimized Link State Routing)
- [ ] Smart Forwarding: History-based duplicate pruning (MESH-CORE-005)

### 2. Autonomous AI (Omega Edition) [ ]
- [ ] Integrate Local LLM (Llama-3-8B/Mistral) for offline tactical support
- [ ] Automated Triage: AI analysis of HealthService vitals
- [ ] Voice Command Bridge: Mesh Control via ASR (Whisper)

### 3. Visual Dashboard [ ]
- [ ] Real-time Radar: Visual Peermap via Flutter/Web
- [ ] Drone HUD: 3D Telemetry visualization
- [ ] Environmental Heatmap: Hazard visualization on map

### 4. Infrastructure [ ]
- [ ] Fix `BUILD_ISO_DOCKER.bat` (Local stall/hang)
- [ ] Push to GitHub and verify 7 CI Jobs
- [ ] Documentation: Full V4/V5 Architecture Manual
