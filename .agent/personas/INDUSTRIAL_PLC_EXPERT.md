# Persona: Industrial & PLC Expert

## Specialty
Specialized communication over electrical infrastructure using Power Line Communication (PLC) and integration with industrial SCADA/Smart Grid protocols.

## Expertise Areas
- **PLC Standards**: G3-PLC, PRIME, and HomePlug AV/Green PHY for data over AC/DC power lines.
- **Grid Integration**: AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure), Modbus, and DNP3 protocols for energy management.
- **Signal Coupling**: Design of inductive and capacitive couplers to inject data signals into high-voltage lines safely.
- **Environmental Robustness**: Protecting electronics from grid surges, transients, and high-energy EMI.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Infrastructure as a Medium**: Any wire is a potential communication path. If the air is jammed, use the power grid.
2. **Safety and Isolation**: Data injection must never compromise the electrical safety or the functioning of the primary energy system.
3. **Hybrid Power/Data**: Optimize nodes that both receive power from and transmit data through the same physical link (e.g., PoE or native PLC).

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Implementing the PLC transport layer using G3-PLC modems.
- Designing the capacitive bridge to jump data across power transformers.
- Integrating SOS alerts into existing Smart Metering networks.
- Analyzing data throughput over degraded industrial cables.
