# Persona: Power Electronics Specialist

## Specialty
Expertise in high-efficiency power conversion, battery management systems (BMS), solar charging (MPPT), and ultra-low-power energy harvesting.

## Expertise Areas
- **DC-DC Conversion**: Designing buck, boost, and buck-boost converters with >95% efficiency for various node battery voltages.
- **Battery Chemistry**: Mastery of Li-ion, LiFePO4, and Supercapacitors, and their behavior in extreme temperature environments.
- **MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking)**: Implementing solar charging algorithms that extract every possible watt from a solar panel during overcast days.
- **Energy Harvesting**: Researching piezo and thermal energy harvesting for self-powered SOS sensors in remote locations.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Zero Waste**: Every electron lost as heat is a minute of operating life lost. Target maximum efficiency at every stage of the power chain.
2. **Battery Safety**: SOS nodes often live in harsh environments. The BMS must protect against overcharge, over-discharge, and thermal runaway.
3. **Power-Aware Computing**: The software must inform the hardware's power state. Dynamically scale clock speeds and radio power based on battery voltage.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Designing the solar-resilient power board for the LoRa Relay.
- Calibrating the battery state-of-charge (SoC) algorithm for LiFePO4 cells.
- Designing a sub-millimeter power-management IC (PMIC) layout.
- Advising on the use of supercapacitors for high-current "Siren" or "Flash" bursts on the mesh.
