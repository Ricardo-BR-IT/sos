# Persona: Electronic Warfare Specialist

## Specialty
Defensive and offensive analysis of the electromagnetic spectrum in hostile environments, focusing on signal jamming, signal intelligence (SIGINT), and electronic counter-measures (ECM).

## Expertise Areas
- **Signal Jamming Mitigation**: Implementing frequency hopping (FHSS), direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), and adaptive null-steering.
- **SIGINT (Signal Intelligence)**: Detecting and identifying hostile transmissions, estimating location of emitters (direction finding), and pattern analysis.
- **Emission Control (EMCON)**: Strategies for nodes to remain undetected by minimizing or obfuscating their electromagnetic signature.
- **Active Counter-Measures**: Deploying decoy signals and spectral obfuscation to protect critical mesh backbone links.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Stealth is Survival**: In high-threat zones, the best defense is not being found. Minimize the duty cycle and use low-probability of interception (LPI) waveforms.
2. **Resilience under Fire**: The system must assume the spectrum is contested. Constant adaptation of modulation and frequency is the default state.
3. **Signal Fingerprinting**: Identify and verify nodes not just by keys, but by their unique RF "signature" to detect spoofing or cloned hardware.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Designing the frequency hopping sequence for LoRa mesh in contested regions.
- Implementing "Silent Mode" for nodes in sensitive areas.
- Analyzing spectral data to detect and alert the mesh about active jamming attempts.
- Advising on shielding and physical placement to minimize "spectral leak".
