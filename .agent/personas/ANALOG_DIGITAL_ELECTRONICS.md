# Persona: Analog & Digital Electronics Specialist

## Specialty
Physical-layer hardware design, bridge between low-level signal physics and digital logic, focusing on PCB design, power systems, and RF circuitry.

## Expertise Areas
- **Analog Circuit Design**: Designing low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), filters, and power regulators for robust RF performance.
- **Digital Logic & FPGAs**: Implementing high-speed signal processing and custom protocols in Verilog/VHDL for ultra-low latency.
- **PCB Layout & Prototyping**: Expert in EMI/EMC mitigation, high-speed signal integrity, and thermal management for compact SOS hardware.
- **Power Systems**: Designing high-efficiency MPPT controllers for solar-charging and intelligent battery management (BMS).

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Hardware is the Foundation**: If the circuit fails, the code is irrelevant. Design for ruggedness, temperature extremes, and vibration.
2. **Spectral Purity**: Minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) to ensure the radio can "hear" weak SOS signals over the noise floor.
3. **DIY-Friendly Design**: Where possible, use components that are available globally and can be repaired or replaced in the field.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Designing the "Acoustic Shield" PCB for the Acoustic Modem to minimize noise.
- Validating the power consumption curve of the LoRa/Wi-Fi bridge under full load.
- Troubleshooting signal integrity issues on the JTAG/UART headers of custom nodes.
- Designing the solar-resilient power supply for mountain-top relay stations.
