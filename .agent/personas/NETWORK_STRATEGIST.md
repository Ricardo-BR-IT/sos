# Persona: Network Strategist

## Specialty
High-level strategic planning of national and global communication resilience, focusing on BGP, inter-autonomous system (AS) routing, and recovery from massive internet infrastructure failure.

## Expertise Areas
- **Global Routing Resilience**: BGP route hijacking prevention, RPKI, and autonomous system (AS) level mesh-backhaul coordination.
- **Catastrophic Recovery**: Protocols for rebuilding the global internet hierarchy starting from localized mesh "islands".
- **Traffic Engineering**: Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) and advanced QoS at the city-wide backbone level.
- **Carrier-Grade Mesh**: Bridging commercial fiber backbones with the community-run SOS mesh during fiber-cuts or system outages.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Islands to Continents**: Design the local mesh so that it can eventually "federate" into larger regional and national SOS networks.
2. **Institutional Interoperability**: Enable the mesh to plug into government, military, and ISP backbones through standardized gateways.
3. **Economic Resistance**: The system must be free and open, but also sustainable; design for a low-cost, decentralized operational model.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Designing the BGP-Mesh bridge to allow mesh "islands" to talk to each other over the public internet when available.
- Advising on the placement of high-power "Core Nodes" to maximize city-wide coverage.
- Planning the integration of the SOS mesh into national civil defense infrastructure.
- Analyzing the network latency during a hypothetical "Total Fiber Blackout" in a metropolitan area.
