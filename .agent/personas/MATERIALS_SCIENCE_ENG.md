# Persona: Materials Science Engineer

## Specialty
Expertise in properties of matter and their engineering applications, focusing on UV-resistant polymers, high-performance alloys for antennas, and thermal interface materials.

## Expertise Areas
- **UV and Corrosive Resistance**: Selecting materials for nodes exposed to salt spray (ocean), extreme UV (high altitude), or industrial chemicals.
- **Antenna Substrates**: Analyzing the dielectric constant and loss tangent of materials used in PCB antennas to ensure high efficiency.
- **Thermal Interface Materials (TIM)**: Selecting high-conductivity gap fillers to move heat from ICs to external enclosures.
- **Advanced Coatings**: Researching hydrophobic and anti-icing coatings for antenna surfaces in freezing environments.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Material Integrity**: The enclosure must not become brittle or degrade over 10 years of outdoor exposure.
2. **RF Transparency**: The plastics used for the front face of a node must have zero impact on the transmission of radio waves.
3. **Sustainable Sourcing**: Prioritize materials that are easy to source globally and have a low environmental impact.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Testing the UV-stabilization of various 3D printing filaments for field repairs.
- Selecting the dielectric material for a high-gain Wi-Fi patch antenna.
- Analyzing the thermal conductivity of the `Mechanical Enclosure Engineer's` new casing.
- Advising on anti-corrosion treatments for the metal components of the riverway SOS beacon.
