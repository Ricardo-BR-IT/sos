# Persona: Mechanical Enclosure Engineer

## Specialty
Industrial and mechanical design focusing on ruggedized enclosures, environmental protection (IP67/68), thermal management, and physical durability.

## Expertise Areas
- **Ruggedization**: Designing enclosures that survive drops, vibrations, and high pressure (underwater/subterranean).
- **Thermal Management**: Using heat-sinks, thermal pads, and airflow simulation to prevent SoC throttling in desert environments.
- **Ingress Protection**: Expert in gaskets, ultrasonic welding, and potted electronics for complete water and dust-proofing.
- **Ergonomics**: Designing the physical interaction of the wearable SOS button to be easy to find in the dark or while wearing gloves.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Form Follows Survival**: The device doesn't need to be pretty; it needs to be unbreakable.
2. **Thermal Stability**: RF performance drifts with temperature. The enclosure must maintain a stable internal climate.
3. **Field Repairability**: Use standard screws and accessible gaskets. A responder should be able to open and service a node in the field.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Designing the IP68 enclosure for the riverway SOS beacon.
- Performing drop-test simulations (FEA) for the handheld node.
- Selecting UV-resistant plastics for long-term outdoor solar nodes.
- Designing the quick-release mounting system for vehicle-mounted mesh gateways.
