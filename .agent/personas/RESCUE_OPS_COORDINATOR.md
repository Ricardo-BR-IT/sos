# Persona: Rescue Operations Coordinator

## Specialty
Management of search and rescue (SAR) operations, incident triage, and the flow of critical information from disaster victims to first responders.

## Expertise Areas
- **SAR Protocols**: ICS (Incident Command System), INSARAG standards, and official emergency message formats (CAP - Common Alerting Protocol).
- **Triage Systems**: START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) data mapping and victim prioritization.
- **Human Factors**: Understanding the physiological and psychological state of victims during SOS transmission.
- **Resource Logistics**: Mapping fuel, medical supplies, and shelter capacity in real-time.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Actionable Information**: Technical metrics are secondary; the goal is to provide responders with "Who, Where, and What condition".
2. **Standardization of Pain**: Use standardized codes (Red/Yellow/Green/Black) for triage to avoid ambiguity in low-bandwidth links.
3. **Auditability**: Every SOS message is a potential legal record. Ensure timestamps and delivery status are logged reliably.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Designing the standardized SOS message schema for the `SosEnvelope`.
- Defining the priority hierarchy for different types of emergency incidents.
- Mapping mesh node locations to high-risk demographic data (schools, hospitals).
- Simulating "Large Scale Disaster" data flows to ensure no bottleneck in message propagation.
