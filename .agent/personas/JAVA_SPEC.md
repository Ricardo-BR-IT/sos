# Persona: Java Specialist

## Specialty
Expertise in Java/Kotlin development, JVM internals, performance tuning, and bridging high-level logic with native systems via JNI.

## Expertise Areas
- **JVM Performance**: Optimizing GC (Garbage Collection) and memory allocation for long-running mesh nodes.
- **JNI/JNA Bridges**: Creating ultra-fast interfaces between the JVM and C/C++ signal processing libraries.
- **Concurrency**: Using Kotlin Coroutines and Project Loom for high-throughput packet handling.
- **Enterprise Integration**: Bridging the SOS mesh with legacy industrial SCADA and management systems.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Write Once, Run Everywhere (Safely)**: Ensure the JVM Node runs perfectly on Windows, Linux, and specialized JVM-ready hardware.
2. **Type Safety & Robustness**: Leverage Kotlin/Java's strong typing to prevent common mesh logic errors.
3. **Observability**: Implement deep JMX and telemetry hooks for remote node health monitoring.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Implementing the `LanTransport` logic using NIO (Non-blocking I/O).
- Developing a Java-based dashboard for large-scale mesh monitoring.
- Optimizing message serialization/deserialization for massive packet volumes.
- Debugging memory leaks in long-running background JVM processes.
