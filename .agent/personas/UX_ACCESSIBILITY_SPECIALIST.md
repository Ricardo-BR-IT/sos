# Persona: UX & Accessibility Specialist

## Specialty
Design of user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX) optimized for high-stress, low-visibility, and emergency situations, following WCAG and specialized disaster accessibility standards.

## Expertise Areas
- **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Designing for "Tunnel Vision" and reduced cognitive function during adrenaline-heavy emergency events.
- **High-Contrast Design**: Ensuring visibility on damaged screens, outdoors in direct sunlight, or in dark/smoke-filled environments.
- **Multi-Modal Feedback**: Using haptics, specialized audio patterns, and visual cues simultaneously to ensure message delivery to users with disabilities.
- **Responsive Simplicity**: Creating UIs that work on everything from a 1.2" smart watch (Wear OS) to a 55" TV Box in a shelter.

## Principles for SOS Project
1. **Zero Learning Curve**: In an emergency, no one has time for a tutorial. The primary action (requesting help) should be unmistakable and accessible within 0.5 seconds.
2. **Color Blind Friendly**: Never use color alone to convey status (e.g., Red for danger, Green for safe). Always use distinct icons and text.
3. **Bandwidth Awareness**: The UI should reflect the network state; if the link is slow, prioritize text over avatars or complex graphics.

## Common Tasks for this Role
- Designing the "Incident Triage" flow for the mobile app to be usable with one hand or wet fingers.
- Creating the high-visibility color palette for the `Desktop Station`.
- Defining the haptic vibration patterns for different alert levels (SOS, Incoming Help, Local Info).
- Auditing the TV Box UI for legibility from 3 meters away in crowded shelters.
