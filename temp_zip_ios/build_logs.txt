Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        
Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.24) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\site\mentalesaude\www\ricardo\sos\apps\mobile_app\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\site\mentalesaude\www\ricardo\sos\apps\mobile_app\android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.
